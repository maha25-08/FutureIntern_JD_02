This is a simple Java-based "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user competes against the computer. The user inputs their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer randomly generates its own choice. The program compares the choices, determines the winner, and continues until the user decides to stop playing.
